"The layout tool follows the same principle as page inheritance: the "
"placeholders will be filled with the smart snippets and plugins from a "
"selected page, unless you specifically override a placeholder with a new "
"smart snippet or plugin. Select a page from which to inherit existing "
"template placeholders, and the smart snippets and plugins that fill those "
"placeholders. Selection can be done through the change view of the object "
"that uses this layout. For most sites, selecting the site's master page "
"will pull in the placeholders that make up the header, footer, and right"
" rail for a site. </br> <b>NOTE</b>: Because of the way blogs, the "
"extra-page-content and main-content placeholders will be filled "
"programmatically with content, and are not available for smart snippets "
"and plugins."
