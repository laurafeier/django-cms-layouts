"The layout tool follows the same principle as page inheritance: these "
"placeholders are inheriting the smart snippets and plugins on the specified"
" page (Page used in this layout). Click the ”View on site” button to see "
"which smart snippets and plugins are already included. Adding a new smart"
" snippet or plugin to one of the placeholders will override these inherited"
" smart snippets and plugins.<br/>"
"<b>NOTE</b>: Because of the way blogs work, the extra-page-content and "
"main-content placeholders will be filled programmatically with content, "
"and are not available for layout-related smart snippets and plugins."
